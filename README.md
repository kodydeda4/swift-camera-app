### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
**SwiftUI:** For building the user interface.
**AVFoundation:** For camera and video recording functionalities.
**Swift-Concurrency:** For reactive programming and handling data flow.
**MVVM:** Application architecture.
**UIKit:** Lightweight integrations with existing UIKit views.

## User Permissions

The [swift-sharing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing) library makes it possible to easily preview the app in different states - such as when a user is missing specific permissions.

## Camera

[AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturevideopreviewlayer) allows you to connect the camera to the UI. The app uses compiler directives to let you preview the camera directly in SwiftUI previews.

## Countdown

[Swift structured concurrency
](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/) is used to create a timer that increments every second.  [Swift-issue-reporting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-issue-reporting) is used to provide an unimplemented closure to execute once the timer is finished.

## Settings

A custom [swift-navigation](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-navigation) view-modifier was created to drive the overlay thru a binding.

## Library

[PhotoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit) allows you to work with image & video assets that the photos app mangages. `Main` model listens for changes and caches them to shared state, for the `Library` feature to observe.

```swift
final class MainModel {
  ...
  func task() async {
    await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { taskGroup in
      taskGroup.addTask {
        let photosContext = try await self.fetchOrCreateAssetCollection(
          withTitle: PhotosContext.title
        )
        await MainActor.run {
          self.$photosContext.assetCollection.withLock {
            $0 = photosContext
          }
        }
        for await fetchResult in await self.photos.streamAssets(
          .videos(in: photosContext)
        ) {
          await self.syncVideos(with: fetchResult)
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

## Video Player

`VideoPlayer` model allows you to handle all the logic for the video player.

```swift
@MainActor
@Observable
final class VideoPlayerModel {
  let video: PhotosContext.Video
  ...
  @CasePathable
  enum Destination {
    case share(ActivityModel)
  }
}
```

## Share

[UIActivityViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiactivityviewcontroller) allows you to present the share sheet dynamically, such as when a user taps a button. A [SwiftUI view modifier ](https://github.com/kodydeda4/swift-share-link) was created to let you model the destination without dropping down to UIKit.

```swift
@MainActor
@Observable
final class ActivityModel: Identifiable {
  let id: UUID
  let activityItems: [UIActivityItemProvider]
  let applicationActivities: [UIActivity]
  var completionWithItemsHandler: UIActivityViewController
    .CompletionWithItemsHandler
}
```
